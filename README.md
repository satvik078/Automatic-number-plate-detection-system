## 🔍 Overview

The **Automatic Number Plate Detection System** is a Python-based project designed to **detect Indian HSRP number plates** and calculate the **speed of moving vehicles** using computer vision techniques. This intelligent system leverages **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to extract vehicle numbers and **optical flow** algorithms with reference measurements to estimate vehicle speed accurately.

## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Real-time number plate detection** from video or image feed  
- 🔢 **OCR-based recognition** of HSRP-style Indian number plates  
- 🚦 **Speed detection** using optical flow and calibrated distance  
- 🧠 Built with pure Python and OpenCV  
- 📊 Displays both **vehicle number** and **speed** on output
